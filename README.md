Overall Project:

I made a stacker game with 5 LEDs and a 7-Segment display.

Components:
1. 5 LEDs
2. 7-Segment display
3. button

Component Description:

The lights will be flashing from left to right and back from right to left. The goal of the game is to hit the button when the light is in the middle.
Whenever you manage to hit the light in the middle you'll gain a point which will be displayed on the 7-Segment display. It will keep incrementing as long as you keep hitting the middle light. 
If miss the middle LED and hit one of the other LEDs your score will reset to 0.
